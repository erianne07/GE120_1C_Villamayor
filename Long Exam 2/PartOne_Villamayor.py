1. In Procedural Programming, like the name suggests, it requires you to have a specific and certain type of procedure for it to work
it tends to be a bit more complicated compared to OOP because it is very particular in the words, letters, and even spaces that is used
in the code. While OOP is made easier because it allows people to use different properties such as polymorphism, Operation Overloading 
and the like. OOP is more straight to the point and 'user friendly'


2. GUI helps in creating programs and applications because it makes coding easier to do and perform.


3. Operation overloading in OOP is when you have an already existing function and overload it using specific steps, so that you can
use that same function, for a different purpose in the code without it interfereing with one another.


4. Inheritance is similar to a "biological family" there are parent classes and child classes. Parent classes has characteristics
that dictate or become a basis for the characteristics of child classes, while child classes have the characteristics of the parent 
classes as well as their own unique characteristics. Example of parent class is "Animals" has characteristics of "walks" and
its child class can be a "Dog" "walks" and a unique characteristic is "bark"; "Cat" "walks" unique characteristic "meows".
In short, in Inheritance, child classes share the same properties or characteristic of the parent classes and then some more.


5. In Full Stack development there is three parts which is the Database > Back-end > Front-end. If I were to provide an example 
from real life that would make it easier to understand it, I will go with the concept of art in a museum. The database is materials used 
for the artwork or where they come from; nature, paint, pencils, etc. While the Back-end is the person who puts these materials together 
and creates the artwork, basically, the artist or author (Like sina Michealangelo or something). And lastly, front-end is the museum curators
they are the ones who deliver or present the finished artwork to the public, they explain its stories, how it was made, and so on.
In an academic/professional setting, database is the place where you get your sources and data, where it is stored, back-end is the processing of this data
to create something that is specified for a certain objective, and front-end is the one that is being interacted with by the public.
